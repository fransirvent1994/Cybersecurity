For this reason, hubs are not used as often on modern networks; most organizations use switches instead. Hubs are more commonly used for a limited network setup like a home office. \n",

Switches are a part of the data link layer in the TCP/IP model. Overall, switches improve performance and security."

The router reads the IP header information and forwards the packet to the next router on the path to the destination. This continues until the packet reaches the destination network. Routers can also include a firewall feature that allows or blocks incoming traffic based on information in the transmission. This stops malicious traffic from entering the private network and damaging the local area network."
