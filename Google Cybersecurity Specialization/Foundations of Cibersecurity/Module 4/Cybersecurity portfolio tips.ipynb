    "<b><u>What is a portfolio, and why is it necessary?</b></u>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Cybersecurity professionals use portfolios to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge. Professionals typically use portfolios when they apply for jobs to show potential employers that they are passionate about their work and can do the job they are applying for. Portfolios are more in depth than a resume, which is typically a one-to-two page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments. You will have the opportunity to develop a resume, and finalize your portfolio, in the last course of this program. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Options for creating your portfolio </b>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "There are many ways to present a portfolio, including self-hosted and online options such as:\n",

    "Description: A documents folder is a folder created and saved to your computer’s hard drive. You manage the folder, subfolders, documents, and images within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Document folders allow you to have direct access to your documentation. Ensuring that your professional documents, images, and other information are well organized can save you a lot of time when you’re ready to apply for jobs. For example, you may want to create a main folder titled something like “Professional documents.” Then, within your main folder, you could create subfolders with titles such as:\n",
