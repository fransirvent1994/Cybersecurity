    "Previously, you learned about past and present attacks that helped shape the cybersecurity industry. These included the LoveLetter attack, also called the ILOVEYOU virus, and the Morris worm. One outcome was the establishment of response teams, which are now commonly referred to as computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). In this reading, you will learn more about common methods of attack. Becoming familiar with different attack methods, and the evolving tactics and techniques threat actors use, will help you better protect organizations and people."

    "Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: \n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.</li>"

    "Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question.

    "Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority.

Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.\n",

    "<li>Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. </li>\n",

    "<li>Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. </li>\n",
